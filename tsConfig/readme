Here, we will modify the tsconfig.json file::

You can learn more at https://aka.ms/tsconfig

In tsConfig.json file we include 2 properties

1.CompileOptions
2.Include

In Include property ,we will pass array of string as ["src"] : this means we must to create src folder to write ts code in it.

Then in CompileOptions, we need to include mainly :

compileOptions:{
"target":"es2022", // This is for the typescript version
"module":"es2022", // This is for converting the TypeScript version to the JS version
" rootDir":"src", // Where we will find list of our code file in this folder
"outDir":"dist", // Whatever the TS files will be converted to JS files
"strict":true // Same as "use strict"
}

{
"compilerOptions": {
"target": "es2022",
"module": "es2022",
"moduleResolution": "bundler",
"strict": true,
"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
"useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
"exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
"skipLibCheck": true,
"rootDir": "src",
"outDir": "dist"
},
"include": ["src"]
}

We need to change in package.json also.
Add this in package.json
"scripts":{
"build":"tsc -p tsconfig.json",
"dev":"tsc -p -w tsconfig.json"
},

To run we just navigate to the folder tsconfig and write npm run dev We will see Dist folder containing JavaScript code compiled from Typescript.

**\*** Very file we will have readme file.please go through it.
