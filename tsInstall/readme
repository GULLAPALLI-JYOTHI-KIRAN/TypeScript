2.npm i -D typescirpt ->to install ts node module as devDependence in your folder
3.npx tsc --init -> This will install the tsconfig.Json and file that you will see very framework using TS. In Tsconfig.Jsn 5 you will see lot of commands but we need our project requirement comments so we can modify anytime.
